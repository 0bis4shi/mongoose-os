title: "Clubby and Cloud libraries"
---

In order to make development of client applications even easier, we maintain
Clubby and Cloud libraries in a number of languages.

For generated API documentation, please follow:

- [Generated JavaDoc for Cloud library](/cloud_java/latest). Cloud library
  includes the Clubby implementation, plus the helper stubs for accessing the
  cloud. More on that later.
