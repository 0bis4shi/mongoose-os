See [quick start guide](https://mongoose-iot.com/docs/#/quickstart/overview.md/)
on how to build and flash the firmware. Below is an example session:

```bash
miot build        # Build the firmware
miot flash        # Flash the firmware
miot console      # Attach a serial console and see device logs
```
