== Smart.js firmware

=== Configuration infrastructure

After boot, Smart.js creates a WiFi Access Point (AP) called `SMARTJS_??????`,
where `??` are replaced by the hex numbers from device's MAC address.
On that AP, Smart.js runs a web server on address `192.168.4.1` with
a configuration interface:

- Join `SMARTJS_??????` AP and point your browser at link:http://192.168.4.1[]
- Change configuration parameters as needed, press Save.
- The module will reboot with new configuration.

It is possible to add custom parameters to the configuration UI - see section
below. Configuration parameters are accessible by JavaScript code through
`Sys.conf` variable.

=== Filesystem

Smart.js uses SPIFFS filesystem on some of the boards (e.g. ESP8266, CC3200).
SPIFFS is a flat filesystem, i.e. it has no directories. To provide the same
look at feel on all platforms, Smart.js uses flat filesystem on all
architectures.

Below there is a quick description of the files and their meaning.
System files, not supposed to be edited:

sys_init.js::
  Main system initialization file. This file is the only file
  called by the C firmware code.
conf_sys_defaults.json::
  System configuration.
conf_sys_schema.json::
  Contains description of the system configuration, used by the Web UI
  to render controls.
conf.json::
  This file can be absent. It is created by the Web UI when user saves
  configuration, and contains only overrides to system and app config files.
index.html::
  Configuration Web UI file.
sys_*.js::
  Various drivers.

Files that are meant to be edited by developers:

app_init.js::
  Application-specific file. This file is called by `sys_init.js`.
  User code must go here.
conf_app_defaults.json::
  Application-specific configuration file. Initially empty.
  If application wants to show it's
  own config parameters on the configuration Web UI, those parameters should
  go in this file.
conf_app_schema.json::
  Description of the app-specific config options.

When Smart.js starts, it reads `conf_sys_defaults.json`, merges it with,
`conf_app_defaults.json`, and subsequently merges with `conf.json`.
Therefore, in order to override any setting from the default config files,
put the override into `conf.json` - that's exactly what Web UI is doing when
user presses Save button.

`conf_app_defaults.json` file is empty by default. Put your application
specific configuration parameters there, the same way system parameters are
kept in `conf_sys_defaults.json`.
