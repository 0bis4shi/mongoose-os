   firmware burning tool
-  Connect the board to your computer via the USB or serial interface
-  Start Flashnchips.
-  If you are using a USB connector, and "Select port" dropdown is disabled,
   then USB-to-serial driver needs to be installed:
   * CC3200 USB drivers:
   link:https://backend.cesanta.com/FTDI_Driver_Mac.pkg[for MacOS], for
   link:https://developer.mbed.org/media/downloads/drivers/mbedWinSerial_16466.exe[for Windows]
   * FTDI drivers are at
   link:http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm[FTDI website]
   * Drivers for NodeMCU v1 board is at link:https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx[Silabs CP2102 page].
-  Restart Flashnchips after driver installation. "Select port" dropdown must
   automatically pick up a serial port to where your board is connected.
-  For CC3200 board, make sure that SOP2 pin is shorted, or wired to TCK.
-  Press "Flash Firmware" button. That will burn Smart.js firmware on
   the flash memory.
-  When burning is complete, Smart.js automatically connects a console
   to the device, prints device configuration, boot messages,
   and shows an interactive JavaScript prompt. Notice the unique
   "device_id" in the configuration - it will be needed to talk to the cloud.

-  Two numbers shown by prompt
   are available free memory, and memory taken by Smart.js
-  Type some JavaScript expression to the console and press enter.
   Smart.js evaluates the expression and prints evaluation result: +

-  Configure Wifi. This is not needed on POSIX platforms like RPI, where
   networking is already configured. Note that Smart.js provides flexible
   configuration infrastructure, described in the next section. Here,
   we use quick ad-hoc way to configure.
-  Enter `Wifi.setup('WifiNetworkName', 'WifiPassword')` to the console
-  Using your mouse, copy the value of device ID printed earlier
-  Enter `demoSendRandomData()` to start sending random numbers
   to `cloud.cesanta.com` every second, simulating real sensor data.
   `cloud.cesanta.com` however will reject that data, because it doesn't
   accept data from unregistered devices
-  Register the device on the cloud: login to
   link:https://cloud.cesanta.com/#/devices[]
-  Click on "Devices" tab, copy/paste device ID. Leave PSK field blank.
   Press "Add Device" button.
-  Switch to the "Dashboard" tab, and see real-time graph updated: +
