title: Remote control - MQTT
---

This example shows how to control a device remotely using MQTT protocol.
We're going to use Mongoose Cloud, which provides authenticated
MQTT service - but any other public or private MQTT server would also work.

Assuming you have downloaded the
[`miot` utility](https://mongoose-iot.com/software.html) and have registered
an account at [Mongoose Cloud](http://mongoose.cloud),
then follow instructions at
https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose-iot/tree/master/fw/examples/c_mqtt .
