title: Hosted web application
---

Each project automatically gets a USER-PROJECT.appioto.com
domain hosted by [Mongoose Cloud](https://mongoose-iot.com).
A developer can customize it in the online IDE to provide
a Web interface for the end user, or management dashboard, etc.
Changes made in the IDE are immediately deployed to the hosted
web app.
That makes it perfect tool for prototyping user interface
that talks to devices without leaving a browser window.

To enable web app publishing, go to the project's settings
page and click "Enable" button:
