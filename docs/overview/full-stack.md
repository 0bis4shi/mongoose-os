title: Full-stack platform
---

IoT brings things (devices) and Internet (cloud) together.
Mongoose IoT is a full stack platform - that means it provides a solution
for both parts of the equation. On a device side, there is
Mongoose Firmware. On a cloud part, there is Mongoose Cloud.
Cesanta runs [Mongoose Cloud](https://mongoose-iot.com)
as a public service. Also, Mongoose Cloud can be run privately.
