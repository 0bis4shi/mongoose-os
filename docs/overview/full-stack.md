title: Full-stack platform
---

IoT connects things (devices) and the Internet (cloud) together.
A software that sits on devices and a cloud to provide that connectivity
and integration is called an IoT platform. 

Mongoose IoT is a full-stack platform. This means it provides a solution
for both parts of the equation: device and cloud. On the device side, there is
Mongoose Firmware. On the cloud part, there is Mongoose Cloud.
Cesanta runs a managed [Mongoose Cloud](https://mongoose-iot.com) public
service, available for everyone to use.
Alternatively, Mongoose Cloud can be run privately.
