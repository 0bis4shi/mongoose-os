title: Full-stack platform
---

IoT brings things (devices) and the Internet (cloud) together.
Mongoose IoT Platform is a full-stack platform. This means it provides a solution
for both parts of the equation: device and cloud. On the device side, there is
Mongoose Firmware. On the cloud part, there is Mongoose Cloud.
Cesanta runs [Mongoose Cloud](https://mongoose-iot.com)
as a public service. But, it can also be run privately.
