title: Mobile App
---

We provide a ready-to-go Mongoose Mobile App for your IoT
projects. It has the ability to customise the mobile app interface
and functionality, all without writing a single line of
iOS/Android code!

All you need to do, is to describe a set of pages and control
elements you'd like to see in your mobile app in the
Mobile UI Definition file in the IDE, and Mongoose Mobile App
reflects your changes immediately.

MUDL (Mobile UI Definition Language) is a YAML description
of the user interface we have developed to simplify the app creation
for prototypes and proof of concepts.
