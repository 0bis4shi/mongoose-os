title: Mobile App
---

We provide a ready-to-go Mongoose Mobile app for your IoT
projects, with the ability to customize mobile app interface
and functionality - all without writing a single line of
iOS/Android code!

All you need to do is to describe a set of pages and control
elements you'd like to see in your mobile app in the
Mobile UI Definition file in the IDE, and Mongoose Mobile app
will reflect your changes immediately.

MUDL (Mobile UI Definition Language) is a YAML description
of the user interface we have developed to simplify app creation
for prototypes and proof of concepts.
